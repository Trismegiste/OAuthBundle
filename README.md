# OAuthBundle

A minimal oauth security layer for symfony

## Why

Because HwiOAuthBundle cannot handle a dynamic configuration for OAuth Provider
(coming from a database for example)

And there are some bugs and design flaw I don't want and multiple features I don't need.

## How
With league/oauth1-client & league/oauth2-client
